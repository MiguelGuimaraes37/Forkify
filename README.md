<h1>Forkify App</h1>

<p>
  This project was realized during 
  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/" target="_blank">
    Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course
  </a> 
  as the final project.
</p>

<p>
  Both CSS and HTML were provided by the course. The goal of this project was to help users search for, bookmark, and manage recipes, 
  as well as upload their own.
